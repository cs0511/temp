Hi wanghui

    Thank you for your arrangement for my trip.

    From June 10 to June 12(next Monday to Wednesday) is vacation for Dragon Boat Festival in China. And I want to see my nephew in Shanghai. Could I leave Xi'an for Shanghai in June 10? There is two days left in the hotel, could I use it for renting a house when I come back?

    Chinese: 下周一到周三(6.10-6.12)公司端午节放假，我想下周一去上海看望我的外甥，能否预定下周一去上海的机票？这样宾馆的预定会剩余两天，我想在九月十四日(周六)从美国回来的时候租房时暂住。

Best Regards
